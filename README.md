# Simple Complex Number Library

This project is an exercise of using Python's magic dunder methods to create a simple Complex Number library. Relations and operations that are implemented are:
- Addition and subtraction
- Multiplication
- Exponentiation to integer
- Reciprocal and division
- Equality

```
from complex_number import Complex
a = Complex(1, 2)
b = Complex(5, 3)
print(f'{a=} {b=}') # a=1+2i b=5+3i
print(f'{a+b=}') # a+b=6+5i
```

Further examples can be seen on [notebook.ipynb](notebook.ipynb)
